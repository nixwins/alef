					After yesterday's casting news of a black Hermione Granger 
					in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, fans took to Twitter and began 
					riffing on other characters in the series with different nationalities
					JK Rowling even joined in to express her fondness for a few with praise and retweets.

				After bride-to-be Miranda announced that her man had finally popped the question,
				it seemed that their world could be nothing short of a fairy tale. I mean, everyone 
				woman lives to announce their engagement on facebook it seems. Hilariously enough, that magical
				moment didn't really seem to be the case because Miranda had already accidentally tipped off 
				her friends to look a little closer at the photo. She stated that her boyfriend didn't give her an
				actual ring, assuring everyone it will come later, which did nothing other than make people lean in
				a little too close to check out that ring. 
				And that's when everyone also started noticing the weird box in the corner.
